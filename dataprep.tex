\section{Data Collection and Preprocessing}
\label{sec:data}
\fix{Don's section}
Data on GPU life times is constructed from two sources: inventory runs
and failure event records. Two types of failure events were collected:
Double Bit Error (DBE) and Off the Bus (OTB). DBE was found to be the
``signature'' error of eventual GPU failures.

An inventory of GPU serial numbers and their locations is recorded
each time the system boots. \fix{Don, you mentioned that this was more
regular later - daily?} This typically occurs once every few days but
can be as frequent as a few times per day. An inventory at boot time
typically occurs over a span of \fix{??} minutes. A separate file is
produced at each boot time.

The DBE and OTB events are also recorded separately from boot
time inventories. This is recorded as . . . files.

Inventories are taken at boot time, which can occur anywhere from
several times per day to more than a month
apart. Figure~\ref{fig:inventory} shows inter-inventory times that
appear in the data.

Notably, there was a period of over a month that Titan operated
without a single reboot.

Initial processing updates an inventory by checking the Serial Number
(SN) and Location of each GPU and creating or updating a separate
record for each contiguously observed SN-Location combination.


A typical GPU data record is of the form shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dataraw},

\noindent where records for three GPUs are shown. Each record starts
with a serial number and locations are coded with {\tt c{\it
    col-row}c{\it cage}s{\it slot}n{\it node}}. The first GPU record
shows installation in locations {\tt c17-4c1s3n1}, {\tt c21-1c2s5n0},
{\tt c0-1c1s3n3}, with periods off the system, and finally in {\tt
  c13-1c1s3n3}, where it stays until August 1, 2017, after which it is
not seen again. The second is intalled in location {\tt c18-4c1s5n1},
where it stays until the last data collection date on March 3, 2019,
at 3:19:11 AM. The third GPU is first installed in locations {\tt
  c5-4c0s7n0}, {\tt c3-3c1s5n0},{\tt c0-6c1s7n2}, {\tt c23-6c1s7n2},
where a ``DBE'' is observed on November 2, 2018, and it is not seen
again.
