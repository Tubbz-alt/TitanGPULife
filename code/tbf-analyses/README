The tbf_analyses.py code requires the following data file:
    - 'gc_full.csv' which is assumed to be present in the following directory: ../../data/
    
All output figures (in PDF format) will be written to the following directory: ../../figs/

Prerequisite: Python 3 is required to run this code. This code was tested with python 3.8, 
	      although there are no strict requirements as long as Python 3 is available.

	      The matplotlib library is required for generating the plots.
